Recent approaches for this span-level task have been token-level models which have inherent limitations. They cannot easily define and implement span-level features, cannot model overlapping entity mentions and have cascading errors due to the use of sequential decoding. To address these concerns, we present a model which directly models all possible spans and performs joint entity mention detection and relation extraction. We report a new state-of-the-art performance of 62.83 F1 (prev best was 60.49) on the ACE2005 dataset.",

abstract = {Relation extraction (RE) is an important task for many natural language processing applications. Document-level relation extraction task aims to extract the relations within a document and poses many challenges to the RE tasks as it requires reasoning across sentences and handling multiple relations expressed in the same document. Existing state-of-the-art document-level RE models use the graph structure to better connect long-distance correlations. In this work, we propose SagDRE model, which further considers and captures the original sequential information from the text. The proposed model learns sentence-level directional edges to capture the information flow in the document and uses the token-level sequential information to encode the shortest paths from one entity to the other. In addition, we propose an adaptive margin loss to address the long-tailed multi-label problem of document-level RE tasks, where multiple relations can be expressed in a document for an entity pair and there are a few popular relations. The loss function aims to encourage separations between positive and negative classes. The experimental results on datasets from various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose attentive graph convolutional networks (A-GCN) to improve neural RE methods with an unsupervised manner to build the context graph, without relying on the existence of a dependency parser. Specifically, we construct the graph from n-grams extracted from a lexicon built from pointwise mutual information (PMI) and apply attention over the graph. Therefore, different word pairs from the contexts within and across n-grams are weighted in the model and facilitate RE accordingly. Experimental results with further analyses on two English benchmark datasets for RE demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where state-of-the-art performance is observed on both datasets.",

In order to verify the challenges of document-level RE, we implement recent state-of-the-art methods for RE and conduct a thorough evaluation of these methods on DocRED. Empirical results show that DocRED is challenging for existing RE methods, which indicates that document-level RE remains an open problem and requires further efforts.

The graph is constructed using various inter- and intra-sentence dependencies to capture local and non-local dependency information.

We first propose an effective new model, which combines an LSTM sequence model with a form of entity position-aware attention that is better suited to relation extraction. Then we build TACRED, a large (119,474 examples) supervised relation extraction dataset obtained via crowdsourcing and targeted towards TAC KBP relations. The combination of better supervised data and a more appropriate high-capacity model enables much better relation extraction performance. When the model trained on this new dataset replaces the previous relation extraction component of the best TAC KBP 2015 slot filling system, its F1 score increases markedly from 22.2{\%} to 26.7{\%}.",

In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale neural architecture for document-level n-ary relation extraction. Our system combines representations learned over various text spans throughout the document and across the subrelation hierarchy. Widening the system{'}s purview to the entire document maximizes potential recall. Moreover, by integrating weak signals across the document, multiscale modeling increases precision, even in the presence of noisy labels from distant supervision. Experiments on biomedical machine reading show that our approach substantially outperforms previous n-ary relation extraction methods.",

Existing approaches construct static document-level graphs based on syntactic trees, co-references or heuristics from the unstructured text to model the dependencies. Unlike previous methods that may not be able to capture rich non-local interactions for inference, we propose a novel model that empowers the relational reasoning across sentences by automatically inducing the latent document-level graph. We further develop a refinement strategy, which enables the model to incrementally aggregate relevant information for multi-hop reasoning. Specifically, our model achieves an F1 score of 59.05 on a large-scale document-level dataset (DocRED), significantly improving over the previous results, and also yields new state-of-the-art results on the CDR and GDA dataset. Furthermore, extensive analyses show that the model is able to discover more accurate inter-sentence relations.",

As HPSG encodes both constituent and dependency structure information, the proposed HPSG parsers may be regarded as a sort of joint decoder for both types of structures and thus are evaluated in terms of extracted or converted constituent and dependency parsing trees. Our parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance for both parsing tasks on Penn Treebank (PTB) and Chinese Penn Treebank, verifying the effectiveness of joint learning constituent and dependency structures.

Meanwhile, syntactic information has been proved to be crucial for the success of NLP applications. However, how to incorporate the syntax trees effectively and efficiently into pre-trained Transformers is still unsettled. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel framework named Syntax-BERT. This framework works in a plug-and-play mode and is applicable to an arbitrary pre-trained checkpoint based on Transformer architecture. Experiments on various datasets of natural language understanding verify the effectiveness of syntax trees and achieve consistent improvement over multiple pre-trained models, including BERT, RoBERTa, and T5.",

One major challenge of DocRE is to dig decisive details regarding a specific entity pair from long text. However, in many cases, only a fraction of text carries required information, even in the manually labeled supporting evidence. To better capture and exploit instructive information, we propose a novel expLicit syntAx Refinement and Subsentence mOdeliNg based framework (LARSON). By introducing extra syntactic information, LARSON can model subsentences of arbitrary granularity and efficiently screen instructive ones. Moreover, we incorporate refined syntax into text representations which further improves the performance of LARSON. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (DocRED, CDR, and GDA) demonstrate that LARSON significantly outperforms existing methods.",

We first constructed pairs of chemical and disease mentions as relation instances for training and testing stages, then we trained and applied the ME model and the convolutional neural network model for inter- and intra-sentence level, respectively. Finally, we merged the classification results from mention level to document level to acquire the final relations between chemical and disease concepts.

    abstract = "{Relation extraction (RE) is a fundamental task for extracting gene–disease associations from biomedical text. Many state-of-the-art tools have limited capacity, as they can extract gene–disease associations only from single sentences or abstract texts. A few studies have explored extracting gene–disease associations from full-text articles, but there exists a large room for improvements. In this work, we propose RENET2, a deep learning-based RE method, which implements Section Filtering and ambiguous relations modeling to extract gene–disease associations from full-text articles. We designed a novel iterative training data expansion strategy to build an annotated full-text dataset to resolve the scarcity of labels on full-text articles. In our experiments, RENET2 achieved an F1-score of 72.13\\% for extracting gene–disease associations from an annotated full-text dataset, which was 27.22, 30.30, 29.24 and 23.87\\% higher than BeFree, DTMiner, BioBERT and RENET, respectively. We applied RENET2 to (i) ∼1.89M full-text articles from PubMed Central and found ∼3.72M gene–disease associations; and (ii) the LitCovid articles and ranked the top 15 proteins associated with COVID-19, supported by recent articles. RENET2 is an efficient and accurate method for full-text gene–disease association extraction. The source-code, manually curated abstract/full-text training data, and results of RENET2 are available at GitHub.}",
