With the widespread engineering applications ranging from broadband signals and non-linear systems, time-domain integral equations (TDIE) methods for analyzing transient electromagnetic scattering problems are becoming widely used nowadays. TDIE-based marching-on-in-time (MOT) scheme and its fast algorithm are researched in this dissertation, including the numerical techniques of MOT scheme, late-time stability of MOT scheme, and two-level PWTD-enhanced MOT scheme. The contents are divided into four parts shown as follows.
